1) Done executing the command
  a) By executing the command we are trying to find all files of type of f, which means regular files in the /etc directory. Once we have the files, we want the data to be stored in one.txt and all the errors in two.txt.
  b) one.txt has everything - all the files. 
   two.txt has all the errors regarding the files we could not access, in this case it is mainly permission denied files.

2) The top 3 are - 
	March 2006 - 15 channels
 	Jul 2014 - 13 channels
	Aug 2014 - 12 channels 
  The commands were - 
  1) cut -d',' -f20,21 Global\ YouTube\ Statistics.csv > chanelsCreatedMonth.txt
  The d is delimeter which specifies that comma separates the values into columns - > 20 and 21 are column numbers
  2) sort -t',' -k2,2 -k1,1n chanelsCreatedMonth.txt > sorted.txt
  This sorts the second and the first column - the first one based on number and puts it in another file
  3) uniq -c sorted.txt | sort -nr > sortedCount.txt 
  This finds unique pairs and shows the count - this count is sorted in reverse order and transfererd to the file

3) The command is ps -u divijf23
   The output is - 
	PID TTY          TIME CMD
	3527018 ?        00:00:01 systemd
	3527020 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
	3527026 ?        00:00:00 sshd
	3527029 pts/77   00:00:00 bash
	3529800 pts/77   00:00:00 script
	3529802 pts/93   00:00:00 bash
	3557040 pts/93   00:00:00 ps 

4)
  a) Done
  b) I noticed an extra vi process with PID 3591907
  c) Done
  d) Here's the output - 
	 PID TTY          TIME CMD
	3527018 ?        00:00:01 systemd
	3527020 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
	3527026 ?        00:00:00 sshd
	3527029 pts/77   00:00:00 bash
	3529800 pts/77   00:00:00 script
	3529802 pts/93   00:00:00 bash
	3587220 ?        00:00:00 sshd
	3587309 pts/115  00:00:00 bash
	3598162 pts/115  00:00:00 ps  
  I see some extra processes than before

5) init is the process that is run when the computer boots - it is the first process and hence it's pid is 1. 
   We can find it by ps -p 1 ---> first process or generally by ps -aux and then grepping the systemd and finding the first process

6) ps aux is the command which shows a compresensive list of all the processes running, let's see it step by step -
	ps = the status of the processes 
	a = it shows all the processes for all users
	u = it shows user information like username etc
	x = it shows even the processes that are outside the tty (terminal)
   Everything together makes sure that we get a full list of all the processes and related information.
